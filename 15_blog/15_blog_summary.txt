Using text data extracted from the Gutenberg online repository, we have developed a method of unsupervised learning that seeks to measure relative similarity between writing styles present in literary pieces. With our method, we hope to provide an interested reader with an approach for suggesting stylistically similar books or novels to those which the reader may have enjoyed in the past. Because, style is a subjective property of a text, we choose to capture a text's representation through a transformation of its word frequency vector; to measure the effectiveness of our approach, we conclude our study with an examination of authorship attribution which we use as a baseline metric for the effectiveness of our algorithm. Under the assumption that an author will write in a similar style across multiple pieces, our approach's effectiveness is captured in the error present when attempting to attribute authorship to a collection of texts of known authorship.
